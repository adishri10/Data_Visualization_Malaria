## Background
Malaria is a life-threatening disease that is spread to humans by certain types of mosquitoes. The prevalence of malaria is widespread in tropical countries due to their geographic and climatic conditions. Malaria is caused by a parasite called plasmodium which is carried by a female Anopheles mosquito. It mostly spreads to people through the bite of these infected mosquitoes. People with HIV/AIDS, pregnant women, children under 5 years, and travellers are at a higher risk of severe infection. Once the plasmodium is injected into the bloodstream of a healthy person, it travels to the liver cells and multiplies, eventually coming back to the bloodstream as the liver cells burst open. A similar cycle continues in the red blood cells (RBCs) until the RBCs burst open. The typical symptoms of malaria include fever, sweating and chills which can eventually lead to death, if left untreated, due to the depletion of RBCs. However, it is preventable and curable. Malaria can be caused by five different Plasmodium parasites, of which P. falciparum and P. vivax pose the greatest threat. The other malaria species that can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi. 

## Problem and opportunity
Malaria cases increased to 249 million in 2022 from 244 million in 2021, according to the most recent World Malaria Report. The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 608,000 in 2022 compared to 610,000 in 2021. Looking at the number of people affected and the WHO reports, we decided to work on visualizing the trends in Malaria globally and in Peru. 

## Problem statement
Over the past two decades, Malaria cases have accounted for 43.44% of all diseases in Peru. In Loreto, 71.02% of confirmed malaria cases make it the most prevalent disease within the department. Notably, there has been a substantial increase in cases, with a 15.6% rise in 2021 followed by a staggering 69.6% surge in 2022 compared to 2020. 

## Mission statement
Reduce the number of confirmed cases in Loreto (a department of Peru) caused by M. Falciparum (2,416) and M. Vivax (12,817) by 5% in the next 3 years in order to reduce the number of people affected by malaria.

## Analysis stage
The Analytical phase encompasses the meticulous identification of potential root causes that underpin the prevailing issue. In our specific context, we have identified key determinants that exert a significant influence on the disease burden associated with Malaria in Peru. Notably, Peru’s geographical location emerges as a pivotal factor, wherein environmental determinants play a pronounced role in fostering mosquito breeding and subsequent disease propagation.  

## Key Findings
In summary, the escalation of Malaria cases in Loreto can be attributed significantly to environmental factors, including but not limited to the frequency of rainfall, rivers, and temperature. Additionally, socio-economic determinants such as limited access to quality water, prevailing poverty, lack of educational resources and awareness, alongside limited healthcare facilities, inadequacies in vector control strategies and the absence of widespread mosquito net usage, collectively contribute to the persistent rise in Malaria incidents within the region.

## Improve 
Suggested improvements 

1. Poverty: Implement economic development programs to alleviate poverty. Collaborate with NGOs and government agencies to provide financial assistance and resources to impoverished areas. 
2. Humidity and Frequent Rainfall: Enhance infrastructure to manage water stagnation, like improved drainage systems. Implement weather monitoring systems to predict and prepare for periods of high humidity and rainfall. 
3. Limited Use of Preventive Resources: Launch education campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of preventive measures. Provide subsidies or free distribution of preventive resources like mosquito repellents and bed nets. 
4. Limited Access to Water and Poor Water Quality: Develop and improve access to clean water sources. Collaborate with environmental agencies to monitor and improve water quality. 
5. Insufficient Healthcare Facilities: Build and upgrade healthcare facilities, especially in the affected regions. Train healthcare professionals on malaria prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. 
6. Lack of Mosquito Nets: Initiate campaigns for the distribution of mosquito nets to vulnerable populations. Collaborate with local businesses and organizations for sustained distribution. 
7. Insufficient Vector Control Strategy: Invest in research and development of effective vector control methods. Collaborate with experts and organizations specializing in vector control for strategic planning.

## Control
Recommended methods 
1. Monitor and Evaluate: Establish a monitoring system to track the implementation of the improvement measures. Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of interventions through key performance indicators (KPIs). 
2. Continuous Training: Conduct ongoing training for healthcare professionals and community members on preventive measures. Ensure sustainability by incorporating malaria education into the school curriculum. 
3. Community Engagement: Establish community engagement programs to empower residents in sustaining preventive efforts. Encourage community reporting and involvement in monitoring malaria cases. 
4. Regulatory Compliance: Ensure that regulatory standards for water quality, healthcare facilities, and other factors are met and maintained. Implement penalties for non-compliance to encourage adherence. 
5. Adaptive Strategies: Develop adaptive strategies to respond to changing environmental conditions, ensuring ongoing effectiveness. 
6. Documentation and Reporting: Maintain comprehensive documentation of control measures and their outcomes. Establish a reporting system for immediate response to any resurgence in malaria cases.
